#Working Year Plan  - Club Name, Year 

## Key Aspirations
<!-- This is the sexiest part of your Club year plan, the lofty statements that make your members’ hair stand on end when read aloud at your first meeting!

“We will get more petitions signed than any other school in the country this year.”
“We will run open source presentations for every CS class in our university.”
“We will run an education workshop/general meeting every single week of the year.”
“We will be the most active student group on campus!”
“We will have 10 individuals capable of being on next year’s executive team.”

Any of these are examples of key aspirations that are measurable and specific that your Club might have this year. They should be a focal point for your Club’s efforts throughout the year – think of them as the goals that you are prioritizing above all others. Ask the question “above all else, what do we hope to accomplish this year.”

## Goals

<!-- Goals are directional in nature and help guide the writing of specific objectives that when completed, lead to the goals being achieved. Most of the goals should align with the key programs and functions of your Club, and each shoudl have a goal and number you'll use to measure your success.  

"Membership Education: Have two lecture series that bring an expert to talk to the membership, 2 lectures" 
"Teach The Web: We host high-quality events that teach web literacy skills, 5 events"

You can have multiple goals per area of work.
